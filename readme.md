# Transfer Wizard

This branch is focused on transferring photos from a specific camera, the Fuji X-T4. It will work with other models of Fuji camera but has only been tested with the X-T4.

I have removed the functionality around miscelleneous files, and the adaptations that were made for different file formats that do not exist on the photos and videos produced by the X-T4.

### Roadmap

- Write a bash script that runs the program each time the camera or SD card is detected.
- Build a multi-site personal cloud solution with a raspberry pi and Nextcloud.
- Publish a blog post with full instructions to set up your own pipeline including this script and your own cloud so all you have to do to ensure that your photos are automatically transferred and backed up to multiple locations that you control is to connect your SD card.
